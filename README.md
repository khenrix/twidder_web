## A simple social-networking web application for learning purposes

This web application was created to learn some basic web programming techniques.  
Be aware of some ugly code as this is the first 'real' web application I have worked on.
Ruben however had some more experience and by collaborating we achieved a quite decent result.

Big thanks to Ruben for helping me understand the basics and for collaborating with me on this project.
