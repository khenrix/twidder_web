# Lab 1 - Questions for consideration

1. By validating data before sending it to server we let the server do all the work instead of doing unneccesary work on the server. All though you still need to validate data certain data in the back-end for security reasons.


2. The token is somewhat secure assuming someone does not get hold of the token. Well you could access private data by getting the token, through guessing if the token is easily formated.


3. The user would inject code into the system and the code would be executed if the system has not taken any preventions. It opposes as a threat in the way that an attacker can inject code that other users run without knowing it. A counter measure would be to not allow JavaScript code in post requests.


4. We exit Twidder. This is not the exepected behaviour for a single-page website. We are getting this behaviour since this is how normal pages work.


5. It stays the same. Yes, this is expected?


6. What?


7. It's not a bad idea, but not the optimal one. A better way would be to return some kind of error message when an operation has gone wrong.


8. No, it's not reliable. You should also validate data on the server.


9. Tables are not that flexible. Using CSS is better.


10. Not a big fan of SPAs.
